Hey Charmander, how's it going?$
CHARMANDER$
Pretty good man, how are you?$
BULBASAUR$
This is my new SPEECH system.$
Just add a dollar sign after every block or sentence.$
It's far from revolutionary, but it gets the job done.$
CHARMANDER$
Huh. Looks like you created profiles for every character in the scene.$
The cutscene script has the names of all role-players, and the profiles contain data on profile pics.$
Neato-burrito!$
SQUIRTLE$
Pretty fucking lit dude. Anywho, have you guys heard about that new Metroid game?$
CHARMANDER$
Fuck yeah. Looks like a total blast.$
Plus, anything will be an improvement over Other M.$
BULBASAUR$
Don't even MENTION that trainwreck. Let's forget Other M even happened.$
SQUIRTLE$
Agreed. At least they upgraded Zero Suit ass in that game.$
CHARMANDER$
Please. I know Samus Aran is a total babe, but I can jack off anytime I want.$
When I play Metroid, I want to be turned on by my raging destruction of intergalactic space stations.$
SKARMORY$
Hello. I would like to add to the discussion.$
SQUIRTLE$
Fire away, big bird.$
SKARMORY$
First I'd like to point out that adding new characters is a very simple process.$
After all, I joined the conversation with little effort.$
In any case, whenever I play the Metroid games, I feel sympathetic for Ridley.$
CHARMANDER$
That's cause you're a bird, dude!$
If you didn't notice, the rest of us are lacking in the wings department.$
SKARMORY$
Yes, that is visibly evident. In any case, I should be leaving.$
LARVITAR$
Hey! What are you all talking about?$
BULBASAUR$
Oh, great. Who invited the shitstain here?$
LARVITAR$
I wish you wouldn't say that. It's not very nice.$
SQUIRTLE$
What are you gonna do, turtlefuck? Tell on us to your daddy?$
TYRANITAR$
That won't be necessary. I'm right here.$
CHARMANDER$
Oh shit.$
This is a bad situation now.$
Oh, God.$
ARCEUS$
Anyone call for me?$
