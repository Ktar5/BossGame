Hey Charmander, how's it going?$
CHARMANDER$
Pretty good man, how are you?$
BULBASAUR$
This is my new SPEECH system.$
Just add a dollar sign after every block or sentence.$
It's far from revolutionary, but it gets the job done.$
CHARMANDER$
Huh. Looks like you created profiles for every character in the scene.$
The cutscene script has the names of all role-players, and the profiles contain data on profile pics.$
Neato-burrito!$
SQUIRTLE$
Pretty fucking lit dude. Anywho, have you guys heard about that new Metroid game?$
CHARMANDER$
Fuck yeah. Looks like a total blast.$
Plus, anything will be an improvement over Other M.$
BULBASAUR$
Don't even MENTION that trainwreck. Let's forget Other M even happened.$
SQUIRTLE$
Agreed. At least they upgraded Zero Suit ass in that game.$
CHARMANDER$
Please. I know Samus Aran is a total babe, but I can jack off anytime I want.$
When I play Metroid, I want to be turned on by my raging destruction of intergalactic space stations.
